                        <p><a name="top"></a>During the year, UCSD Tzu Ching does a variety of events that aims to fulfill the missions of our parent organization, Tzu Chi. Learn about all of our past events here. At UCSD, our biggest focus is on education  - Everybody Reads, our tutoring event for K to 12 children, is one of most popular and well-attended events.</p>
            <p>However, we hope that we can make an impact both within the local community and in the lives of our volunteers through <em>all</em> of our events. A busy academic career shouldn't keep you from doing meaningful and rewarding work. There are no applications or hoops to jump to join - just meet us at the time and place specified on our event page and meet all the other UCSD Tzu Chings!</p>

			<h2><a name="sharing"></a>Orientation / Sharing Meetings</h2>
            <p class="events">Every quarter, we have an orientation (fall quarter) or sharing meeting (winter/spring quarter) to introduce new members to Tzu Ching, and bring our UCSD Tzu Ching family together after another quarter. Old and new members alike  share their thoughts about past events or just how they feel about being a Tzu Ching. Winter quarter sharing meeting also serves as orientation for those who have not had the chance to learn about Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at UCSD (transfers, new students, people who were unable to attend the Fall meeting). We hope to see you there!

			<h2><a name="campus-recycling"></a>On-Campus Recycling</h2>
            <p class="events">People throw stuff that can be recycled all the time into the trash and garbage bins on campus. What's other people's 'garbage' is Tzu Ching's gold! :) We spend a weekend afternoon looking for recyclable cans and bottles that can be redeemed for cash to help fund our events.

			<h2><a name="convalescent-home"></a>Convalescent Home Visits</h2>
            <p class="events">Often, the elderly at convalescent homes are lonely and they don't a lot of visitors. Every month, we pay a visit to the Convalescent Home to brighten their day! Working with San Diego Tzu Chi, we do musical and dance performances, play games, and chat with them. It's a fun and rewarding experience for us, and the seniors always look forward to our visits, so this is always a wonderful way to start out your weekend.

			<h2><a name="everybody-reads"></a>Everybody Reads</h2>
            <p class="events">One of our most popular events, Everybody Reads is a fantastic opportunity for Tzu Chings to give back to the local San Diego Community. Twice a month, we tutor K-12 children from low-income families and teach them English, math, or other school subjects. This is one of our most popular events, which many of our Tzu Ching members find both fun and extremely rewarding.

			<h2><a name="vendor-fair"></a>Vendor Fair</h2>
            <p class="events">Although most of our events take place off campus, UCSD Tzu Ching always shows up during one day of Vendor Fair to sell our Vegetarian Cold Noodles to the masses of UCSD! Come hang out with us and enjoy our super-special secret recipe :)

			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="veg-cooking"></a>Vegetarian Cooking Class</h2>
            <p class="events">Besides doing community service, we also promote vegetarianism through our events. However, the Vegetarian Cooking Class (taught by talented cooks from the Tzu Chi Foundation) is a hands-on opportunity for Tzu Ching to learn about why vegetarianism is good not just for personal health, but also the environment.

			<h2><a name="orange-picking"></a>Orange Picking for the San Diego Food Bank</h2>
            <p class="events">TC's orange picking event is one not to be missed. Once a year, we leave our UCSD campus bubble to visit privately owned orange groves located in Escondido. These orange trees grow so many oranges that it's impossible for one person to pick them all. As a result, most are usually left to rot. But fear not - with the help of our TC volunteers and the Giving Groves Program, we can save these yummy fruits by picking them, then donating them to the San Diego Food Bank to feed the homeless.
				<br />

			<h2><a name="medical-outreach"></a>Medical Outreach</h2>
            <p class="events">Our medical outreach event is also held in Oceanside. We provide free clinical and dental care to adults and children in the low-income community. Tzu Ching volunteers help translate, fill out forms, and assist the Tzu Chi physicians.
				<br />
				<a href="#top">Top</a>
			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="earth-day"></a>Earth Day</h2>
            <p class="events">Earth Day is an annual event that usually falls on April 17th where we [Tzu Chi] participate by having a booth at the Earth Fair in Balboa Park. It's a great way to introduce Tzu Chi to San Diegans, as well as a great opportunity for you to learn and interact with the many environmental exhibits on site!
				<br />
				<a href="#top">Top</a>
			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="disaster-relief"></a>Local Disaster Relief</h2>
            <p class="events">When disasters such as the Southern California forest fires (2007) occur, we Tzu Chings go to local supermarkets to fundraise for the victims of the disaster. All fundraised money goes towards items such as blankets, monetary gift cards, and basic food items.
				<br />
				<a href="#top">Top</a>
			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="walk-cause"></a>Walk for a Cause</h2>
            <p class="events">In the past, we have helped out with different fundraising events where people walk to raise money for causes such as diabetes or breast cancer. Tzu Ching is one of the many organizations that serve as general volunteers. We help with serving walkers refreshments, secretarial assistance, and other general volunteering.
				<br />
				<a href="#top">Top</a>
			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="walkathon"></a>Walkathon Tzu Chi</h2>
            <p class="events">Tzu Chings from all over southern California gather at the San Dimas headquarters, along with regional Tzu Chi volunteers, to fundraise for disaster relief and learn more about Tzu Chi's missions. In the past, we have had booths set up around the track on vegetarianism, environmentalism, and the other "Tzu Chi footprints".
				<br />

			</p>
            
			<h2><a name="buddha-bath"></a>Buddha Bath</h2>
            <p class="events">Our celebration of Buddha's birthday takes place at Tzu Chi USA's headquarters in San Dimas. It coincides with International Tzu Chi Day and with Mother's Day. It's a day for us to celebrate our love for each other, especially our love for our mothers, as well as our respect for Buddha.

			<h2><a name="socal-social"></a>Southern California Intercollegiate Social</h2>
            <p class="events">Tzu Chings from all over Southern California gather at the host college to meet each other and form closer bonds between the chapters through icebreakers, games, and other interactive experiences. Tzu Ching usually remains in San Diego, but events such as the SoCal Intercollegiate Social show Tzu Ching members that they are part of a larger Tzu Ching and Tzu Chi family that extend all across the globe. We're all one big Tzu Ching family! &lt;3

            <p>The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (Tzu Ching) is a college organization that carries out the missions of the international Tzu Chi Foundation--charity, education, culture, and medicine. Tzu Ching provides an opportunity for volunteer work within the local area that is rewarding, meaningful, and manageable during one's busy college life.</p>
            <p>By providing and caring for our school and community, we seek to cultivate ourselves to become better individuals. After all, "Tzu Ching" means "compassionate youth", and we believe that anyone can bring out the kindness and compassion in their heart. Students of any race and religion are welcome to join our Tzu Ching family here at UCSD! :)</p>
