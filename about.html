            <h2>About Tzu Ching</h2>
            <p>Tzu Ching means &quot;compassionate youth&quot;, and it is shorthand for the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association, which is a college organization that carries out the missions of the Tzu Chi Foundation. We hold events throughout the year - even during the summer, which is out of the academic year - that provides opportunities for busy college students to do volunteer work within the local area that is rewarding and meaningful.</p>
            <p>We seek to cultivate ourselves to become better individuals by providing and caring for our school and community. Although our parent organization, Tzu Chi Foundation, has Taiwanese and Buddhist origins, students of any race and religion are welcome to join our Tzu Ching family at UCSD.</p>
            <h3>Environmental Protection Kits (EPKs)</h3>
            <p class="tzuching-about">Our EPKs are one of many ways that we try to promote environmentalism. By reducing the number of disposable utensils and paper plates, we can minimize our environmental impact and reduce the amount of waste that we as individuals produce - not to mention that they are convenient, fashionable, and groovy! So next time you come to our events, pack along some silverware and a reusable container (Tupperware) and enjoy our delicious, homemade vegetarian food!</p>
            <h3>Vegetarianism</h3>
            <p class="tzuching-about">One misconception about becoming vegetarian is that it's a religious obligation or duty. However, recent studies show that becoming a vegetarian not only benefits your body, but it also has a positive impact on the environment!</p>
            <p class="tzuching-about">How, you ask? Vegetarian diets avoid the significant pollution created by the meat industry (water, air, and animal waste). Eating vegetarian also conserves resources by economizing water, arable land, fertilizers, and pesticides. Some quick stats that may be surprising to you:</p>
            <ul><li class="vegetarianism">Published in the February 2001 issue of Scientific American, Peter H. Gleick states that "growing a pound of corn can take between 100 and 250 gallons of water... But growing the grain to produce a pound of beef can require between 2000 and 8500 gallons."</li>
            <li class="vegetarianism">In the United States, approximately 80% of farmland is used for animal crops and animal water supply.</li>
            <li class="vegetarianism">According to some estimates, supplying the entire world with a western, meat-centered diet would deplete the planet's oil reserves within ten years. </li></ul>
            <h3>Tzu Ching Uniforms</h3>
            <p class="tzuching-about">From the moment you enter Tzu Ching, the first thing you might notice about us are the uniforms that our collegiate members and the volunteers from our parent organization, Tzu Chi, wear. You might be thinking, "Why wear uniforms just to volunteer?"</p>
            <p class="tzuching-about">Tzu Chings wear the uniform to be neat and easily recognized. Sometimes volunteering requires helping strangers and the uniform helps people identify who is and is not a volunteer. The blue shirt and white pants symbolize the goal for Tzu Chi volunteers to keep their minds as wide and open as the blue sky and their actions as pure and clean as the white clouds.</p>
            <p class="tzuching-about">Members should be proud to wear the uniform, it symbolizes their volunteer spirit and makes one appear more professional. Think about Superman and Batman!</p>
            <p class="tzuching-about">It is not only officers who wear the uniforms - all Tzu Ching members can! If you have logged 20 or more hours volunteering for Tzu Ching, you are eligible to purchase a uniform to wear to our events. Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to ask about purchasing your very own Tzu Ching uniform. :)</p>

            <h2>About Tzu Chi</h2>
            <p>Tzu Chi means "compassion(ate) relief" in Chinese. Through great compassion for those who are suffering, we can relieve suffering, be it that of our own, or that of others.</p>
            <p>Tzu Chi Foundation was established in 1966 by a Buddhist nun, Venerable Master Cheng Yen, in the rural, poor eastern coast of Taiwan initially offering food and medical relief for the poor. As she
herself lived a simple, austere life, she encouraged her supporters to save equivalent US$0.02 a day in the belief that even if we are poor, we can help others. Eventually, she and her supporters saved enough to offer food relief to the local poor.</p>
			<p>Tzu Chi has expanded to all five major continents of the world with chapters and offices in 47 countries, and provides aid to over 69 nations. Today, Tzu Chi's major missions are:</p>
            <ul><li><strong>Charity</strong> - Educating the rich to help the poor; inspiring the poor to realize their riches;</li>
            <li><strong>Medicine</strong> - Patient-centered medical care that respects patients as teachers;</li>
            <li><strong>Education</strong> - Educating children to be moral and upright; and,</li>
            <li><strong>Humanistic Culture</strong> - Recording the examples of goodness and integrity for future generations.</li>
            <li><strong>International Relief</strong> - Caring for people in suffering in the global village;</li>
            <li><strong>Bone Marrow Donation</strong> - Donating your marrow to save a life without harming yourself;</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Protection</strong> - Practicising environmental protection to live in harmony with Mother Earth; and,</li>
            <li><strong>Community Volunteers</strong> - By supporting and caring for each other, they make a beautiful neighbourhood.</li></ul>
            <p>The shared goal of Tzu Chi volunteers is to cultivate sincerity, integrity, faith, and honesty within while exercising kindness, compassion, joy, and selflessness to humanity through concrete actions.</p>
