<h2>My question isn't here. Who should I contact for an answer?</h2>
<p>Email <strong>sdtcca@ucsd.edu</strong> anytime. :)</p>

<h2>What does "Tzu Ching" mean? What is Tzu Ching?</h2>
<p>Check out the description in the right sidebar - "Tzu Ching" translates to <em>compassionate youth</em>. UCSD Tzu Ching is a community service student organization on the UCSD campus, and is a part of the collegiate association that carries out the missions of our parent organization, Tzu Chi Foundation. You can read more about Tzu Ching in our <a href="about.html">ABOUT US</a> page.</p>

<h2>What is Tzu Chi?</h2>
<p>Tzu Chi Foundation is a 501(c) non-profit charity and international humanitarian organization with a special consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Tzu Chi has nearly 10 million volunteers and supporters in 50 countries and has provided aid in 70 countries.</p>
<p>For more information about Tzu Chi, please visit our <a href="about.html">ABOUT US</a> page or the <a href="http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/" target="_blank">Tzu Chi USA website</a>.</p>

<h2>Is a certain number of hours required to be a member?</h2>
<p>Not at all! You're a member of the Tzu Ching family no matter how many hours you volunteer or how many events you can come out to.</p>
<p>If you wish to wear the uniform or apply to become an officer, you <em>are</em> required to have served a minimum of 20 hours; however, there is no minimum requirement for general membership.</p>

<h2>Do you have a mailing list I can join?</h2>
<p>Yes, we do! Just email <strong>sdtcca@ucsd.edu</strong> with your request to join the mailing list. As a note, if you come to one of our events and sign in, our secretary team will make sure to add you to the mailing list if you are not already on it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can join our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211404611" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>, which also holds our gallery of event images. We send announcements about upcoming events through the Facebook group, as well, so you can join one or the other as you please!</p>

<h2>Do I have to be an officer to wear the uniform?</h2>
<p>No! Any member with at least twenty service hours can wear the uniform. We highly encourage our members to get a uniform to wear them to events, as it shows our unity as a group and identifies you clearly as a member of Tzu Ching.</p>

<h2>How do I submit reimbursement requests for driving to events?</h2>
<p>In order to receive reimbursement for driving at any Tzu Ching volunteer event, please contact either Michael Aranda (<strong>zaranda@ucsd.edu</strong>) or Ashley Chang (<strong>ashleylchang@gmail.com</strong>) and let one of us know which event the requested reimbursement is for. The amount given is specific to each event and has been calculated based on total driving distance from Peterson Loop to the destination and back.</p>
<p>While not required, it is very much appreciated if you give us a receipt to help with withdrawal of funds from Tzu Ching's student org funding account. Please try to get the receipts in no later than one week after the event has passed. Thanks!</p>

          <div id="col3_content">
            <p>The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (Tzu Ching) is a college organization that carries out the missions of the international Tzu Chi Foundation--charity, education, culture, and medicine. Tzu Ching provides an opportunity for volunteer work within the local area that is rewarding, meaningful, and manageable during one's busy college life.</p>
            <p>By providing and caring for our school and community, we seek to cultivate ourselves to become better individuals. After all, "Tzu Ching" means "compassionate youth", and we believe that anyone can bring out the kindness and compassion in their heart. Students of any race and religion are welcome to join our Tzu Ching family here at UCSD! :)</p>
