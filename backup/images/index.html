<h2>Welcome Back!</h2>
<p>We hope you had a fantastic summer. If you missed us, don't worry - Tzu Ching's Fall Quarter events are under way again, starting with our Fall Quarter orientation!</p>
<p>Come meet old and new members, as well as learn about Tzu Ching, what we do, and local volunteer opportunities, all while enjoying our delicious vegetarian fare.</p>
<p>Orientation will be held at the Dolores-Huerta room, located in the Old Student Center, beginning at 7:00pm. See you there!</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/fall2011-orientation-map.jpg" rel="lightbox" alt="Map to Orientation"><img src="images/fall2011-orientation-map.jpg" border="10" width="150px"><br>Click for a larger map.</a></p>

<h2>the gold of Tzu Ching: Recyclables!</h2>
<p>Do you drink a lot of bottled water at school? How about Vitamin Water, any variety of sports drinks, or canned sodas, juices, and teas? You certainly have conditioner or shampoo bottled in plastic, right? We haven't even gotten to newspaper, class papers, and boxes!</p>
<p>As you know, Tzu Chi and Tzu Ching both promote and use recycling as methods of being more environmentally friendly, as well as to fundraise in order to continue our services in the community. That's why we want to ask YOU for help!</p>
<p>If you have any recyclable bottles or cans, we would like to encourage you to donate them to Tzu Ching. We don't just take water bottles - any plastic container with the recycling symbol, cardboard, or stacks of paper can also go towards our recycling goal or $75!</p>
<p>You can bring recyclables to ANY Tzu Ching event during the quarter. If you have too much for you to carry, please contact one of our officers so we can make arrangements to pick them up. :)</p>
<p><strong>We raised $45 during spring quarter, and hope to meet our $75 goal this year. Help us by saving your recyclables!</strong></p>

<h2>Roses are red, violets are blue...</h2>
<p>If you've done 20 hours, we've got a uniform for you!</p>
<p>Did you know that our Tzu Ching uniforms are not just for officers? If you have volunteered for over 20 hours with Tzu Ching, you can (and are encouraged!) to purchase one of our lovely blue and white uniforms to wear to future events.</p>

            <p>The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (Tzu Ching) is a college organization that carries out the missions of the international Tzu Chi Foundation--charity, education, culture, and medicine. Tzu Ching provides an opportunity for volunteer work within the local area that is rewarding, meaningful, and manageable during one's busy college life.</p>
            <p>By providing and caring for our school and community, we seek to cultivate ourselves to become better individuals. After all, "Tzu Ching" means "compassionate youth", and we believe that anyone can bring out the kindness and compassion in their heart. Students of any race and religion are welcome to join our Tzu Ching family here at UCSD! :)</p>
