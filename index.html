We're sure you all have a lot to share at the Winter Orientation which will be on the 24th of this month. The orientation will be held at "TBA". If you can't find it, give us a call and we'll be sure to guide you to us.</p><p>Again, if you haven't been able to attend any of our events yet, don't worry! New members are always welcome to join in any of our upcoming events. For most events, the meeting place will be on the UCSD campus at Peterson Loop (the side facing the faculty club parking lot). Check the Google calendar, our mailing list updates, or the Facebook group for exact times and dates of upcoming events.</p><p>We will sometimes ask you to bring your "EPK" to events. In otherwords, it's just tupperware; but, it actually stands for Environmental Protection Kit! Read about it here: <a href="about.html">About Us</a>.</p><p>Please note that while officers are required to wear uniforms to most official Tzu Ching events, that doesn't mean that other members cannot also wear uniforms as well! If you've logged over 20 hours with Tzu Ching, you are eligible to get your own uniform. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> for more information.</p><p>Study Hard!<p>Your Tzu Ching Officers</p><!--<p align="center">- ☀ -</p><h2>the gold of Tzu Ching: Recyclables!</h2><p>Do you drink a lot of bottled water at school? How about Vitamin Water, any variety of sports drinks, or canned sodas, juices, and teas? You certainly have conditioner or shampoo bottled in plastic, right? We haven't even gotten to newspaper, class papers, and boxes!</p><p>As you know, Tzu Chi and Tzu Ching both promote and use recycling as methods of being more environmentally friendly, as well as to fundraise in order to continue our services in the community. That's why we want to ask YOU for help!</p><p>If you have any recyclable bottles or cans, we would like to encourage you to donate them to Tzu Ching. We don't just take water bottles - any plastic container with the recycling symbol, cardboard, or stacks of paper can also go towards our recycling goal or $75!</p><p>You can bring recyclables to ANY Tzu Ching event during the quarter. If you have too much for you to carry, please contact one of our officers so we can make arrangements to pick them up. :)</p><p><strong>We raised $45 during spring quarter, and hope to meet our $75 goal this year. Help us by saving your recyclables!</strong></p>--><!-- For ongoing announcements, use H3 tag; paragraphs must use "announcements" class --><br />          </div>        </div>        <!-- Right sidebar with general information about UCSD Tzu Ching -->        <div id="col3">          <div id="col3_content">            <p>The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (Tzu Ching) is a college organization that carries out the missions of the international Tzu Chi Foundation--charity, education, culture, and medicine. Tzu Ching provides an opportunity for volunteer work within the local area that is rewarding, meaningful, and manageable during one's busy college life.</p>            <p>By providing and caring for our school and community, we seek to cultivate ourselves to become better individuals. After all, "Tzu Ching" means "compassionate youth", and we believe that anyone can bring out the kindness and compassion in their heart. Students of any race and religion are welcome to join our Tzu Ching family here at UCSD! :)</p>            <br />            <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>            <br /><!-- Google Calendar (agenda style) for upcoming events --><iframe src="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=300&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=ucsd.tzuching%40gmail.com&amp;color=%23060D5E&amp;ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style=" border-width:0 " width="200" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <!-- begin: #footer -->      <div id="footer">        <p align="center">Copyright © 2010-2012 Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at UCSD.
